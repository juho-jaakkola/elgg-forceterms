forceterms
===============

This plugin forces all new and old users (with the exception
of administrators) to accept the terms of use before they can
start/continue using the site.

For existing users it forwards user to the terms until user
accepts them. For new users it adds a checkbox to registration
form. A link next to the checkbox opens the terms to a lightbox.

The plugin uses the terms page from external pages. When the
terms are updated administrator can reset the time of latest
update from plugin settings.


Installing
